# TOG Frontend tech test

It was a very interesting and challenging project, I feel more confident with React and I'm looking forward to know more about it and speeding up my coding process as well.

# Process and notes

- Missed a commit for the hook creations, I've had some problems installing React-Bootstrap, with conflicting packages. Got it to work in the end, but I didn't commit the "WorkSpaceAPI" file.

- It was the first time I iterated through and array from an API call, this took me some time to understand how to handle the asynchronus call, while trying to map the elements of the array of workspaces.

- I've used React-Bootstrap for the first time, I've been using the regular Boostrap for a while, it was interesting learning how to use it with React.

- One of the workspaces wasn't featuring an image, so I picked one from TOG website as a placeholder.

# What I would have done

Given more time, I would have focused more on the styling aspect, especially changing the different font style as well as the responsivness at different screen sizes, which isn't perfect.

I didn't manage to do the deployement yet but might try this week just to add an extra step.
